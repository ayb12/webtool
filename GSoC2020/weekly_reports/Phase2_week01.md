2. To annotate a sentence, the start and end timestamps of that sentence are chosen.
3. Run the video with each frame having a time gap of 1 second, using VATIC.js. ![completed](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=completed&color=green)
4. Objects in a frame will be detected automatically using a trained object detection model, which will also create bounding boxes around them. Changes to the code for obtaining the actual pixel coordinates of bounding boxes will also be made.
5. The coordinates of the pixels that serve as corners to a detected object's bounding box will be saved in a list or csv file ![completed](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=completed&color=green)
