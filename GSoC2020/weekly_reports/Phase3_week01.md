Remember to use tags! You can add multiple tags to any task.

![completed](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=completed&color=green) = done and ready for User Acceptance Testing (UAT)<br>
![uat-passed](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=UAT&message=passed&color=success) = tested and ready to merge with Master<br>
![deployed](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=deployed&color=success) = merged with Master<br>
![carryover](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=carryover&color=yellow) = task deferred from one week to the next<br>
![help](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=need_help&color=blue) = needs help from mentors<br>
![definition](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=needs_definition&color=orange) = **blocked** task that needs discussion with mentors<br>
![important](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=important&color=red) = something that needs to be addressed immediately<br>
