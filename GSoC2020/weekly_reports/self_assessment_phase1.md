# Self Assessment: GSoC 2020 Phase 1

This writing documents my assessment of what I did and how I felt about my work. 

## Week 01 - 02
The bulk of my time is spent on implementing the LU and frame identification parts of Johannsen et al.'s (2015) any-language frame semantics parser. I definitely felt frustrated because the short paper left out a lot of the implementation details. Not only that illustrations of steps are excluded, the libraries quoted in the paper did not work at all! It took me longer than expected to implement the parser (about 50 hours a week).

## Week 03
I worked on two of my stretch goals: compiling a survey paper for multilingual semantic role labeling and creating a syntax-agnostic semantic role labeler for frame semantics. The parser overfitted (so it's a failure), and after the meeting with my mentors, a survey paper is not necessary for the frame semantics field. After some back-and-forth exchanges with my mentors, my stretch goal should be creating a multilingual frame-semantics parser that identifies LUs, frames, and frame elements. 

## Week 04 
This week is supposedly a buffer week where I evaluated the performance of the models on identifying LUs and semantic frames. Not only that I completed my tasks, but I also wrote a blog post about the result. I am very proud of the visualizations in the blog post (note that the post is a stretch goal). I also documented my codes and uploaded them to this GitHub repo.
