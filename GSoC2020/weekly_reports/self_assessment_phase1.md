# Self Assessment: GSoC 2020 Phase 1

This writing documents my assessment of what I did and how I felt about my work. 

## Week 01 - 03
The bulk of my time is spent on implementing the LU and frame identification parts of Johannsen et al.'s (2015) any-language frame semantics parser. I definitely felt frustrated because the short paper left out a lot of the implementation details. Not only that illustrations of steps are excluded, the libraries quoted in the paper did not work at all! It took me longer than expected to implement the parser.
