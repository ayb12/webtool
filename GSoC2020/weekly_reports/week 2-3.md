3. As the work of previous week,further discussions needed to be made on the prototype that was developed for the implementation of Section 1.2. ![completed](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=completed&color=green)

### Challenges and solutions
 
 Regarding the Section 1.2 implementation ; some changes were discussed and the tech stack for the implementation was discussed and Vue and D3 were finalised. Some boilerplate 
 code was decided to be used. Regarding the PHP Maestro framework , a document was shared and studied for the understanding of the implementation. Then I started with the
 coding/updation of the existing code. The code of the export and import of XML code was already present but there was an error when it was executed as the UI was not loading.So I
 worked on it. Same pattern of the code was used for a lot of other modules in the webtool, so these seemed a good source for the comparing what was going wrong.
 
### Tasks completed

Some parts of the implementaion of XML import is done.


### Tasks postponed to next week
