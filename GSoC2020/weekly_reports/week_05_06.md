## Week 05 - (Jun 29 - July 12)

### Tasks scheduled for this week
- Perform dependency parsing on the sentences. ![completed](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=completed&color=green)
- Train the binary classifier on <frame, argument, subtree> dataset provided inhttps://github.com/andersjo/any-language-frames. ![carryover](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=carryover&color=yellow)
- Apply the trained classifier on the subtrees of the sentences for semantic role prediction. ![carryover](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=carryover&color=yellow)
- Use the multilingual constituency parser to generate the constituents for the aligned sentences. ![carryover](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=carryover&color=yellow)
- Use nested for-loop to implement the total-alignment model. ![carryover](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=carryover&color=yellow)
- Project frame elements to the constituents in the unannotated sentences that have high Jaccard'scoefficients. ![carryover](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=carryover&color=yellow)


### Challenges and solutions
1. **Multilingual Constituency Parsing**:
  - `en` ![completed](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=completed&color=green)
  - `de` ![failed](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=failed&color=red)
    - The [Berkeley Neural Parser](https://github.com/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser) requires >12 GB of GPU RAM to parse German sentences.
    - Asking on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yongzhengxin/status/1281034412059242498) and searching on [Made with ML](https://madewithml.com/projects/search-results/?tags=constituency-parsing) but to no avail
  - `pt` ![failed](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=failed&color=red)
    - I found the [constituency parser](http://lxcenter.di.fc.ul.pt/services/en/LXServicesParser.html) (from the paper “Top-Performing Robust Constituency Parsing of Portuguese: freely available in as many ways as you can get it”) However, it is an web-app and the output is an image (not usable).
    - [Palavras](https://visl.sdu.dk/visl/pt/parsing/automatic/parse.php) only offers morphosyntactic parsing, morphological tagging, dependency parsing, semantic roles, and NER parsing. It doesn’t offer constituent parsing. 

**Solution**: Constituency-to-word total alignment model (en -> pt or en -> de).

2. **Baseline: Any-language Frame Semantics Parsing**
- It is unclear how the argument identification part of the parser receives input such as the dependency path, the head word of s has lemma λ, lemma λ is realized in some word in s, the voice denoted in the span, etc. 
- It is also unclear how the dependency parser from TurboParser is trained since the pre-trained parsers for languages such as Spanish and Bulgarian are not provided. Moreover, some of the links, such as the link to datasets, on the page of TurboParser are broken.

**Solution**: It is unfeasible to use any-language frame semantics parser to identify frame elements.


### Tasks postponed to next week

![deployed](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=deployed&color=success) = merged with Master<br>
![carryover](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=carryover&color=yellow) = task deferred from one week to the next<br>
![help](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=need_help&color=blue) = needs help from mentors<br>
![definition](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=needs_definition&color=orange) = **blocked** task that needs discussion with mentors<br>
