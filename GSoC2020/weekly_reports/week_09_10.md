### Challenges and solutions

### Tasks completed
**Sentence Alignment for TED Talk Corpus**
- Successfully aligned sentences for TED Talk Corpus using `vecalign`: [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wfT2JBH-ePHxi2GHJU7w1U7xnHn9Ng8eLi09uyoAVws/edit#gid=362930422)
- Attempted aligning sentences for TED Talk Corpus using "LABSE" (Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding) but the results were disappointing. 

**Additional Parallel Corpora**
- Successfully used LASER and FAISS to generate annotated parallel corpora data from the multilingual dataset for the paper "Any-language frame-semantic parsing".
