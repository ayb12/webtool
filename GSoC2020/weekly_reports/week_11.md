## Week 11 - (Aug 10 - Aug 16) 

### Tasks scheduled for this week

- Implement Portuguese constituency parser. ![completed](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=completed&color=green)
- Identify the projected LU using the `sklearn.metrics.pairwise` module. 
- Train SDEC to cluster LUs in FrameNet 1.7 and create semantic frame embeddings. 
- Identify the best-fitting frames for the projected LU using the `sklearn.metrics.pairwise` module on the embeddings of the project LU and the frame.
- Create the attention mechanism using https://github.com/thomlake/pytorch-attention 
- Train the attention mechanism to learn to disambiguate LUs using the annotated sentences in Global FrameNet and exemplar sentences from FN 1.7 and FrameNet Brasil.
- Apply the attention mechanism to the n-gram embeddings of a sentence to disambiguate the LU given the projected semantic frame.
- Obtain the SegRNN model from https://github.com/swabhs/open-sesame. 
- Create the attention mechanism using https://github.com/thomlake/pytorch-attention and train it on the annotated sentences. Augment the SegRNN model with the trained attention mechanism.
- Apply the augmented SegRNN on the unannotated sentences to label the semantic roles.
